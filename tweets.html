    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of an HTML
        document. With CSS, you can control the color, layout, font, and spacing of elements on a web page, making it
        more attractive and user-friendly.</p>

    <h2>Types of CSS</h2>
    <p>There are three main types of CSS: Inline, Internal, and External. Inline CSS is used directly within HTML
        elements, Internal CSS is placed within a &lt;style&gt; tag inside the HTML &lt;head&gt;, and External CSS links
        to a separate .css file. Using external stylesheets is generally recommended for cleaner code and easier
        maintenance.</p>

    <h2>CSS Syntax</h2>
    <p>CSS syntax consists of selectors and declaration blocks. A selector targets the HTML element, and the declaration
        block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property and a
        value, such as <code>color: blue;</code>.</p>

    <h2>Importance of CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS plays a crucial role in modern web design. It helps separate content from presentation, enhances page
        performance, and improves user experience. Responsive design, animations, and custom themes are all possible
        thanks to the flexibility of CSS.</p>
